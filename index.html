        Counting its ramifications and secondary constructions, it is estimated that it is about 21 200 kilometers long, from the border with Korea, at the edge of the Yalu River, to the Gobi Desert, along an arc that outlines approximately the southern edge of Inner Mongolia, although only 30% of it is preserved today. On average, it is 6 to 7 meters high and 4 to 5 meters wide.</p>

      <h4>Petra - <code>Jordan</code></h4>
      <p>Petra is an important archaeological site in Jordan, and the capital of the ancient Nabataean kingdom, whose inhabitants called it Raqmu. The name of Petra comes from the Greek πέτρα that means stone, and its name is perfectly suitable; it is not a city built with stone but, literally, excavated and sculpted in the stone.
        The settlement of Petra is located in a narrow valley, east of the Arava Valley that extends from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The most famous remains of Petra are undoubtedly its constructions carved into the very rock of the valley (hemispheres), in particular, the buildings known as the Khazneh (the Treasure) and the Deir (the Monastery).</p>

      <h4>The Great Pyramid of Giza</h4>
      <p>Finished around the year 2570 B.C., it was built for the Pharaoh Cheops. Located in Giza, Egypt, it is the oldest, largest and most durable.</p>

      <p>Built in 605 B.C.-562 B.C. located in the city of Babylon, current Iraq. They lasted until no more than 126 B.C., when the city was definitively destroyed by the Persians. It is the wonder that raises more doubts about its existence.</p>

Antipater considered it the most impressive work on his list by far.</p>

      <p> Begun by the satrap Mausolo and continued by his wife Artemisia towards 353 B.C. in the city of Halicarnassus ( present Turkey ). It is assumed that it stood out from the other buildings because of its height and the white color of the materials used.5 Its name became synonymous with a great funeral monument.</p>

      The selection of the 7 wonders of the modern world
    </header>
    <div>
      <p>The selection of the 7 wonders of the world today was a way of updating the 7 wonders of the ancient age of which, as we saw earlier, only one remains (the Great Pyramid of Giza). Why are there 7 specifically? Because of the Hellenistic culture, which considered the number 7 as the perfect figure.
        The 7 wonders of the modern world were chosen in 2007 through an international public contest in which more than 100 million people from all over the world participated. Voting was done by SMS and Internet (specifically by registration by email).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The seventh election caused some commotion since official entities such as UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and who is in charge of declaring the selected sites as World Heritage, did not endorse the selection. In addition, nothing prevented a person from voting more than once, as long as they used another cell phone or email. Nevertheless, the seven wonders of the world that were established were the ones we have today. And, without a doubt, they are spectacular places worth visiting.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>With nine days to go before the winners of the New 7 Wonders of the World contest are announced in Lisbon, Portugal, the controversy does not cease.
        The discussions are not only due to the close competition among the 20 man-made works that have reached the final of this contest, which began in 1999 thanks to Swiss-Canadian millionaire Bernard Weber.
        So much has been the furore among the public, that until a few days ago nearly 50 million people had voted on the website www.new7wonders.com, by phone and via text messages.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The contest organizers even announced several days ago that they had removed the ranking from their website because the positions of the candidates were constantly changing due to a sharp increase in the volume of voting.
        Initially, the sites voted for by the public were 77, from the nearly 200 that had been nominated by Weber, president of the New 7 Wonders Foundation, based in Zurich (Switzerland).
        A panel of architectural experts, chaired by Federico Mayor, former director of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), then reduced the list to 21 potential wonders.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The friction began this year, when Egypt banned the image of the pyramids of Giza (the only one of the ancient wonders still standing) from appearing in the advertising of the New 7 Wonders, arguing that they were already a wonder.
        The organization of the contest determined that they could not be voted for and that they would be catalogued as "honorary candidates" of the contest. In spite of the inconvenience, the publicity increased and the governments of China and Brazil invited their citizens to vote for their candidates - the Great Wall and Christ the Redeemer, respectively - and even private enterprise got mixed up in the affair. In Mexico, Coca-Cola printed soda cans with legends asking people to choose the Chichen Itza pyramid as one of the seven wonders.
        Despite the boom it has had, Weber's idea suffered the most recent blow in that election week, when UNESCO cut off any link to the contest. This organization argued that it was doing so in order to avoid a "regrettable confusion" between its mandate to protect world heritage and the "media campaign" undertaken "in a private capacity" by Weber, which "will not be able to contribute in a significant and lasting way to the preservation of the sites chosen by the public".
        UNESCO also stressed that the election of the new seven wonders will be made only with the votes of the population that has access to the Internet and not of the whole planet.
        In any case, with voices for and against, the remaining nine days will be key for the world to know what their New Seven Wonders will be.</p>
